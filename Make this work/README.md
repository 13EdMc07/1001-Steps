KAQUI - The Music app

Using the Discogs api, Bandsintown api, Google Maps api and last.fm api we will return music, showtimes, and popularity when a user searches a musical act. Our application will return specific band showtimes and locations, communicating with googlemaps to post specific map data. In addition, the application will return ratings of the music pulled off of Last.Fm and the latest musical releases gleaned from the Discogs API.

MVP
General Idea
A music app that outputs where acts are playing in the greater Austin area, a rating based on Last.FM (Using BandsinTown and Google Maps), and links to recent releases of music. 

Target Audience
Music lovers and people looking for entertainment

Primary Problem
People sometimes don't who they want to hear, they just know what they want to hear. The MVP does not provide for a search based on genre. If we can get the MVP going, we can set up a search engine based on genre, and also recommend bands that sound like the searched band.

We need to figure out what happens when the band is not returned with a result from bandsintown.

Primary Goal
A one stop shop for music showtimes and catching up with a band's latest releases. 

USER STORIES-

As an urbanite hipster, I want wo know where my favorite bands are playing and buy their music so I can enjoy an entertaining evening with friends.


Notes:
Kaqui (kah koo ee) is a silly way of spelling "Kakui~", which means "Oh how cool!" in Japanese.

Pain points:

**FIXED** Uploading ed's code
work on HTML and children after ed's uploading
We need BandsInTown's API
We may abandon the Discogs marketplace

Adding images to the band boxes

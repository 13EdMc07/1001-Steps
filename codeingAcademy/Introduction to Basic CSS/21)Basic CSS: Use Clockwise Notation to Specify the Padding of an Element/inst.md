Instead of specifying an element's padding-top, padding-right, padding-bottom, and padding-left properties individually, you can specify them all in one line, like this:

padding: 10px 20px 10px 20px;

These four values work like a clock: top, right, bottom, left, and will produce the exact same result as using the side-specific padding instructions.

Use Clockwise Notation to give the ".blue-box" class a padding of 40px on its top and left side, but only 20px on its bottom and right side.

Your blue-box class should give the top of elements 40px of padding.
Your blue-box class should give the right of elements 20px of padding.
Your blue-box class should give the bottom of elements 20px of padding.
Your blue-box class should give the left of elements 40px of padding.
You should use the clockwise notation to set the padding of blue-box class.

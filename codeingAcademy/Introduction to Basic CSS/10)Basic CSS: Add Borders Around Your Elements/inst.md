CSS borders have properties like style, color and width.

For example, if we wanted to create a red, 5 pixel border around an HTML element, we could use this class:

<style>
  .thin-red-border {
    border-color: red;
    border-width: 5px;
    border-style: solid;
  }
</style>
Create a class called thick-green-border. This class should add a 10px, solid, green border around an HTML element. Apply the class to your cat photo.

Remember that you can apply multiple classes to an element using its class attribute, by separating each class name with a space. For example:

<img class="class1 class2">

Your img element should have the class smaller-image.
Your img element should have the class thick-green-border.
Your image should have a border width of 10px.
Your image should have a border style of solid.
The border around your img element should be green.

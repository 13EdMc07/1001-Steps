An element's margin controls the amount of space between an element's border and surrounding elements.

If you set an element's margin to a negative value, the element will grow larger.

Try to set the margin to a negative value like the one for the red box.

Change the margin of the blue box to -15px, so it fills the entire horizontal width of the yellow box around it.





Your blue-box class should give elements -15px of margin.

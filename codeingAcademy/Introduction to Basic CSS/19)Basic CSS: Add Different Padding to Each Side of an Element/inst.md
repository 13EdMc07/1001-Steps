Sometimes you will want to customize an element so that it has different amounts of padding on each of its sides.

CSS allows you to control the padding of all four individual sides of an element with the padding-top, padding-right, padding-bottom, and padding-left properties.

Give the blue box a padding of 40px on its top and left side, but only 20px on its bottom and right side.





Your blue-box class should give the top of the elements 40px of padding.
Your blue-box class should give the right of the elements 20px of padding.
Your blue-box class should give the bottom of the elements 20px of padding.
Your blue-box class should give the left of the elements 40px of padding.

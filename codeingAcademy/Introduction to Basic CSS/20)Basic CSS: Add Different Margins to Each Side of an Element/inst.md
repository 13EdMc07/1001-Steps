Sometimes you will want to customize an element so that it has a different margin on each of its sides.

CSS allows you to control the margin of all four individual sides of an element with the margin-top, margin-right, margin-bottom, and margin-left properties.

Give the blue box a margin of 40px on its top and left side, but only 20px on its bottom and right side.





Your blue-box class should give the top of elements 40px of margin.
Your blue-box class should give the right of elements 20px of margin.
Your blue-box class should give the bottom of elements 20px of margin.
Your blue-box class should give the left of elements 40px of margin.

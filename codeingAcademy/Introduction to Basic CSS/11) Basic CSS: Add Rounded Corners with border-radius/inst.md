Your cat photo currently has sharp corners. We can round out those corners with a CSS property called border-radius.

You can specify a border-radius with pixels. Give your cat photo a border-radius of 10px.

Note: This challenge allows for multiple possible solutions. For example, you may add border-radius to either the .thick-green-border class or the .smaller-image class.

Your image element should have the class "thick-green-border".
Your image should have a border radius of 10px

An element's margin controls the amount of space between an element's border and surrounding elements.

Here, we can see that the blue box and the red box are nested within the yellow box. Note that the red box has a bigger margin than the blue box, making it appear smaller.

When you increase the blue box's margin, it will increase the distance between its border and surrounding elements.



Your blue-box class should give elements 20px of margin.

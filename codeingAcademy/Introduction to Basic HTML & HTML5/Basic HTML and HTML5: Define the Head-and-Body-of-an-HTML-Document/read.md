You can add another level of organization in your HTML document within the html tags with the head and body elements. Any markup with information about your page would go into the head tag. Then any markup with the content of the page (what displays for a user) would go into the body tag.

Metadata elements, such as link, meta, title, and style, typically go inside the head element.

Here's an example of a page's layout:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <!-- metadata elements -->
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- page contents -->
  </body>
</html>
Edit the markup so there's a head and a body. The head element should only include the title, and the body element should only include the h1 and p.





There should be only one head element on the page.
There should be only one body element on the page.
The head element should be a child of the html element.
The body element should be a child of the html element.
The head element should wrap around the title element.
The body element should wrap around both the h1 and p elements.
